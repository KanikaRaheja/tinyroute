# Contributing

Before contributing make sure there is an existing open and labelled issue
related to your contribution.

## Pull request process

All PRs go through a review process before they are accepted.

Make sure that:

* There are no `unwrap`s in the code (`unwrap` is accepted in tests)
* There is test coverage of your code if applicable (some code is hard to test)

## Code of conduct

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards others

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to
any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to
remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers have the right to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for
other behaviours that they deem to be inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
